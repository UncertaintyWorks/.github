# 🔮 UncertaintyWorks

Welcome to **UncertaintyWorks** – an open-source collective for mathematical and quantum computing tools.

We build software and visual platforms around:

- ⚛️ **Quantum Machine Learning** (with PennyLane, Cirq)
- 🧠 **Interactive Jupyter-based visualizations** for circuits and simulations
- 📐 **Math libraries** on fractals, topology, and chaos theory
- 🧩 **Physics-inspired AI** (dynamical systems, symbolic reasoning)

Our goal is to make complex systems **visual, intuitive, and open**.
